# Pathfinding Visualizer

Welcome to Pathfinding Visualizer! I built this application using REACTJS. You can access it here (use Google Chrome!): https://muddledluck.github.io/Pathfinding-Algorithm-Visualization/

## Algorithms

This application supports the following algorithms: 

**Dijkstra's Algorithm** (weighted): The father of pathfinding algorithms; guarantees the shortest path

**A* Search** (weighted): Best pathfinding algorithm; uses heuristics to guarantee the shortest path much faster than Dijkstra's Algorithm

**Greedy Best-first Search** (weighted): A faster, more heuristic-heavy version of A*; does not guarantee the shortest path

**Breath-first Search** (unweighted): A great algorithm; guarantees the shortest path
